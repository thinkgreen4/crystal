                      I am 27 years old and was born and raised in Salt Lake. I love the outdoors and have been an avide skier since I was three. My hobbies include skiing, music, swimming,camping, and being outdoors. I feel extremely peaceful and calm whenever I am in nature. 
                   <br>
                    I graduated from the University of Utah in 20016 with a bachelor degree in Economics. The global economy and it's history have always fascinated me. I got into coding through online courses on my own and recenlty enrolled in a bootcamp to polish my skills.
                    <br>
                    I also love to dabble in poetry. This is a small poem I wrote.
                    Life began with light spinning a harmonious verse of beautiful sound. Spinning round and round the light was captured in the water and ground. The light began to compound until the right mixture was found.
